BeeGees is a Snakemake workflow for recovering high-quality protein-coding DNA barcodes from low-coverage NGS data at scale. Built around [MitoGeneExtractor](https://github.com/cmayer/MitoGeneExtractor) and tailored for genome skims of museum specimens, it takes raw reads through preprocessing, reference retrieval, barcode recovery, consensus cleaning, and structural and taxonomic validation, producing a validated barcode FASTA, a unified per-sample metrics CSV, and an interactive MultiQC report.

> **Supported markers**: **COI-5P** and **rbcL** (so far).

> **Supported sequence data**: paired-end Illumina/Element Biosciences & single-end Ultima Genomics.

# Requirements #
- **Reads** in `.fastq`/`.fastq.gz` format - either paired-end or single-end from Ultima Genomics sequencing.
- **`samples.csv`**
- **`sequence_references.csv`**
- **Activated conda environment** (see `beegees_env.yaml`).
> **Note for pip users:** all 'scientific tool' dependencies (Snakemake, MitoGeneExtractor, fastp, TrimGalore, BLAST, nhmmer, etc.) come from the BeeGees conda environment. `pip install beegees` provides the CLI only - the pipeline will not run without the BeeGees conda environment active.


---


# Installation # 
The `beegees` pipeline can currently be downloaded via by:
1. Cloning the beegees respository
```
gh repo clone bge-barcoding/BeeGees
# Or
wget https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```
3. As a pip through PyPi
```
pip install beegees
```

> `beegees` will be available as a conda package through bioconda in the near future.


--- 


# Quick start #
### 1. Create beegees conda environment
```
conda env create -f beegees_env.yaml
```

### 2. Complete samples.csv 
Create the `samples.csv` or edit `/beegees/config/samples_template.csv`, with sample identifier (ID), forward (SE data-only) and reverse read paths (PE data), and heirarchical taxonomy or NCBI taxonomic identifiers (taxid) - [see section below for details](#Generate-input-sample-CSV-file).

### 3. Download suitable BLASTn database and corresponding taxonomy mappings file
Required for taxonomic validation of generated barcode consensus sequences - [see section below for details on available databases](#Validation-process) or [guidance on creating your own BLASTn database and mapping file](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/docs/README_custom_blast_dbs.md)

### 4. Populate config.yaml for pipeline configuration
Fill in paths to required files, set parameters, credentials, and resource allocations - [see section below for details](#Modifying-snakemake-configuration-file)

### 5. Run BeeGees using the `beegees run` command with the appropriate profile:

**SLURM** (recommended for SLURM-based HPC clusters): run directly on the login node - Snakemake farms each rule out as a separate SLURM job:
```bash
# Activate beegees_env 
conda activate beegees_env

# Execute beegees submissions script
bash run_slurm.sh
```

**Local** (all rules run on the current node - suitable for interactive compute sessions):
```bash
# Create interactive SLURM session (resources are divided amongst rules based on their deliniated resource allocations, thereby determining the degree of parallelisation - see config.yaml rule resource block for allocations)
srun --pty --mem=128G --cpus-per-task=16 --time=08:00:00 bash

# # Execute beegees submissions script
sbatch run_local.sh
```

> Use `beegees run --help` for additional options (e.g. `--cores`, `--dryrun`, `--log-file PATH` to write a live log file).
> Depending on your HPC cluster architcture and job schedular, you may need to edit the partition in `run_*.sh`, `config.yaml` rule resource block, and `slurm_partition` in `profiles/slurm/config.yaml`


# Workflow #
<img width="1829" height="853" alt="BeeGees workflow diagram" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/017062f4-51c1-43b3-b9fd-6277820b45e4" />


1. **Preprocessing** - the run mode is detected automatically from `samples.csv` (see [Run mode detection](#run-mode-detection)):
   - **PE concat**: adapter trimming, quality filtering, poly-G trimming and deduplication with [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp), then R1+R2 concatenation, secondary quality trimming with [TrimGalore](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), and optional downsampling.
   - **PE merge**: quality control and merging of overlapping read pairs with fastp, header cleaning for MitoGeneExtractor compatibility, and optional downsampling.
   - **SE (Ultima Genomics)**: adapter trimming, poly-X tail trimming and deduplication with fastp using Ultima-specific settings. No merge or concat step.
2. **Sample-specific reference retrieval** - taxonomically appropriate protein references are pulled from GenBank by [Gene Fetch](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/gene_fetch).
3. **Barcode recovery** - protein reference-guided extraction of barcode sequences from preprocessed reads using MitoGeneExtractor, producing initial consensus sequences.
4. **Consensus preparation** - header standardisation and concatenation of raw consensus sequences into multi-FASTA.
5. **Consensus cleaning and filtering (`fasta_cleaner`)** - sequential filters applied to MGE read alignments to remove contaminants and outliers before generating cleaned consensus sequences:
   - Human COI contamination removal, common in museum specimens ([`01_human_cox1_filter.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/01_human_cox1_filter.py))
   - AT content filtering, targeting suspected fungal/bacterial contamination ([`02_at_content_filter.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/02_at_content_filter.py))
   - Statistical outlier removal of reads dissimilar to the initial consensus ([`03_statistical_outlier_filter.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/03_statistical_outlier_filter.py))
   - Optional custom reference-based filtering ([`04_reference_filter.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/04_reference_filter.py))
   - Cleaned consensus generation and metrics aggregation ([`05_consensus_generator.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/05_consensus_generator.py))
6. **Barcode validation and selection** (see [Validation process](#validation-process)):
   - **Structural validation** - HMM-based barcode extraction, reading frame analysis, stop codon detection and quality ranking ([`structural_validation.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/structural_validation.py))
   - **Local BLASTn search** - parallel searches of structurally validated barcodes against a local reference database ([`tv_local_blast.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/tv_local_blast.py))
   - **Taxonomic validation** - hierarchical matching of BLAST results against expected taxonomy, selecting the best sequence per sample ([`tv_blast2taxonomy.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/tv_blast2taxonomy.py))
7. **Statistics compilation** - QC, recovery, cleaning, filtering and validation metrics aggregated into CSV reports ([`compile_barcoding_stats.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/compile_barcoding_stats.py)).
8. **Final integration** - all pipeline metrics merged into a unified output CSV ([`val_csv_merger.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/val_csv_merger.py)).
9. **Barcoding outcome** - per-sample success called as PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL from the unified CSV ([`barcoding_outcome.py`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/workflow/scripts/barcoding_outcome.py)).
10. **Cleanup** - removal of temporary files and redundant sample-specific logs.

# Preparing inputs #
 
## samples.csv ##
- This can be created manually, or via the [sample-processing](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/sample-processing) workflow if working from specimen metadata downloaded from the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD).
- Must contain the headers **`ID`**, **`forward`**, and either **`taxid`** _or_ hierarchical taxonomy columns (`phylum`–>`species`).

- **`ID`** - unique sample identifier. Because of regex matching and statistics aggregation, the sample ID is taken as the string before the first underscore, so **avoid `_` characters in sample names** (e.g. `BSNHM002-24` rather than `BSNHM002_24`, `P3-1-A10-2-G1` rather than `P3_1_A10_2_G1`).
- **`forward`** - absolute path to the forward (R1) read file, gzipped or not. For SE/Ultima runs this is the only read file required.
- **`reverse`** _(optional)_ - absolute path to the reverse (R2) read file. See [Run mode detection](#run-mode-detection).
- **`taxid`** _or_ **hierarchical taxonomy** - either an NCBI taxid, found by searching the expected species/genus/family in the [NCBI taxonomy database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy), or a taxonomic lineage (columns `phylum`, `class`, `order`, `family`, `genus`, `species`), from which the taxid of the lowest identified rank is retrieved.


**Paired-end (taxid)**
 
| ID | forward | reverse | taxid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BSNHM002-24 | abs/path/to/R1.fq.gz | abs/path/to/R2.fq.gz | 177658 |
| BSNHM038-24 | abs/path/to/R1.fq.gz | abs/path/to/R2.fq.gz | 177627 |
| BSNHM046-24 | abs/path/to/R1.fq.gz | abs/path/to/R2.fq.gz | 3084599 |
 
**Single-end / Ultima (taxid)**
 
| ID | forward | reverse | taxid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UK001-A01 | abs/path/to/reads.fq.gz | | 177658 |
| UK001-A02 | abs/path/to/reads.fq.gz | | 177627 |
| UK001-A03 | abs/path/to/reads.fq.gz | | 3084599 |
 
**Paired-end (hierarchical taxonomy)**
 
| ID | forward | reverse | phylum | class | order | family | genus | species |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BSNHM002-24 | abs/path/to/R1.fq.gz | abs/path/to/R2.fq.gz | Arthropoda | Insecta | Hemiptera | Cicadidae | Tibicina | Tibicina tomentosa |
| BSNHM038-24 | abs/path/to/R1.fq.gz | abs/path/to/R2.fq.gz | Tracheophyta | Pinopsida | Pinales | Pinaceae | Abies | |
| BSNHM046-24 | abs/path/to/R1.fq.gz | abs/path/to/R2.fq.gz | Annelida | Polychaeta | Terebellida | Ampharetidae | Samytha | Samytha sexcirrata |


---
 

## Run mode detection ##
Run mode is inferred from the `reverse` column of `samples.csv`:
- **Paired-end** - a `reverse` path is provided for all samples. Both `concat` and `merge` preprocessing modes run.
- **Single-end (Ultima)** - the `reverse` column is absent or empty for all samples. Only `se` mode runs.
**The `reverse` column must be consistent across all samples.** Mixed SE/PE samples in the same CSV cause the pipeline to exit with an error.
 
> **SE/Ultima preprocessing specifics** - fastp runs in SE mode with Ultima-tuned settings: poly-X tail trimming (targeting the poly-T 3' artefacts characteristic of Ultima flow-based chemistry), poly-G trimming disabled (Ultima is not a two-colour system), and deduplication enabled. Adapter auto-detection is the primary adapter trimming mechanism, on the assumption that Ultima-specific adapters have already been removed by Ultima Genomics' Trimmer tool. Barcode recovery and all downstream processing are identical to PE mode, with outputs written to `se_mode/` (analogous to `merge_mode/` and `concat_mode/`).


---


## Sample-specific pseudo-reference retrieval ##
`sequence_references.csv` can be created manually or generated within the workflow by [Gene Fetch](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/gene_fetch) (recommended). Setting `run_gene_fetch: true` in `config.yaml` retrieves protein pseudo-references for each sample from NCBI GenBank using its taxid or taxonomic hierarchy. This requires a sequence target (e.g. COI) and your NCBI credentials - email address and API key (see [guidance on obtaining a key](https://support.nlm.nih.gov/kbArticle/?pn=KA-05317)).
 
The file must contain the headers **`ID`** and **`protein_reference_path`**:
- **`ID`** - must match the `ID` column of `samples.csv` exactly.
- **`protein_reference_path`** - absolute path to the protein pseudo-reference used for sample-specific protein-guided read alignment.

| ID | protein_reference_path |
| --- | --- |
| BSNHM002-24 | path/to/BSNHM002-24.fasta |
| BSNHM038-24 | path/to/BSNHM038-24.fasta |
| BSNHM046-24 | path/to/BSNHM046-24.fasta |
 
> **Important:** the sample ID, the reference FASTA filename, and the reference FASTA header **must** currently all be identical for correct sample-to-reference mapping. Gene Fetch handles this automatically.

       structural_validation and taxonomic_validation rules
```

## Cluster profiles ##
The `beegees/profiles/` directory contains `config.yaml` files for SLURM and local submission. Beyond `slurm_partition` and `jobs` (if running `/profiles/slurm/config.yaml`), the defaults can usually be left alone.
 
- **`slurm_partition`** - the default partition for each Snakemake job, unless overridden in `config/config.yaml` rule resource block. Use a partition with at least a 6-12 hour time limit to be safe.
- **`jobs`** (SLURM profile only) - maximum number of concurrent workflow jobs. This is a fair-share/queue-etiquette limit rather than a local resource one - the jobs themselves run on compute nodes. Raise for large batches if the queue allows. Too low creates a bottleneck; too high risks hitting filesystem limits, job submission limits, quotas and fairshare policies, leaving many jobs pending. For example, under a 256 GB per-user memory limit, `jobs: 20` with 32 GB per MitoGeneExtractor job means only 8 run in parallel while the remaining 12 'pend'.

>Select the profile with the `--profile` flag of `beegees run`.

# Validation process #

The BeeGees pipeline includes a barcode validation process (see [Workflow](#Workflow) section) to ensure output barcode quality is maximised through sequential structural and taxonomic validation steps, selecting the best barcode consensus sequences for downstream analyses.

Reference data required per marker:
- **COI-5P** - the [BOLDistilled](https://boldsystems.org/data/boldistilled/) BLASTn database and its taxonomy mapping (`*_SEQUENCES.fasta` and `*_TAXONOMY.tsv`, via the ['Download Source Data'](https://us-sea-1.linodeobjects.com/boldistilled/source.zip) button), plus [`COI-5p.hmm`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/resources/hmm/README.md).
- **rbcL** - the [custom reference](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17040680.v5) BLASTn database and taxonomy mapping (`*_dereplicated_*.fasta` and `*_dereplicated_*.tsv`, [download](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/56104238)), plus [`rbcL.hmm`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/resources/hmm/README.md).

> Guidance on building a custom BLASTn database and matching taxonomy TSV is in [`docs/README_custom_blast_dbs.md`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/docs/README_custom_blast_dbs.md).

>  Information on how the supported barcode HMMs were constructed can be found in [`docs/README_hmm_info.md`](https://github.com/bge-barcoding/BeeGees/blob/main/docs/README_hmm_info.md).

## Structural validation ##
Structural validation (via `structural_validation.py`) assesses every barcode consensus sequence to identify high-quality, protein-coding those suitable for taxonomic assignment. It outputs a CSV of structural, translation and quality-rank metrics for all sequences, plus `output_barcode_all_passing.fasta` containing every sequence that passes all five criteria below (a single process ID may have multiple passing sequences).

1. **Barcode region extraction** - strip tilde characters (`~`) representing missing gene regions, replace gaps (`-`) with `N`, align against the marker-specific HMM profile with nhmmer, reconstruct the barcode in HMM coordinate space, and trim leading and trailing `N`s while preserving internal ambiguous bases.
2. **Structural analysis** - calculate sequence length, gap distribution (leading/trailing/internal) and `N` count, distinguishing *original* `N`s (`barcode_ambiguous_bases_original`, indicating genuine quality issues) from processing-introduced `N`s (`barcode_ambiguous_bases`, all `N`s in the final sequence).
3. **Translation analysis** - translate in all three reading frames (0, 1, 2) using the specified genetic code, count stop codons in each, and select the frame with the fewest.
4. **Quality ranking** - assign a rank from 1 to 6 based on original `N`s, stop codons, reading frame validity and base count (lower is better):
   | Rank | Criteria |
   | --- | --- |
   | 1 | Perfect - no original `N`s, no stop codons, valid frame, ≥500 bp |
   | 2 | High quality - as above, 400–499 bp |
   | 3 | Good quality - as above, 300–399 bp |
   | 4 | Acceptable - as above, 200–299 bp |
   | 5 | Minimal - as above, 1–199 bp |
   | 6 | Problematic - contains original `N`s or translation issues |
5. **Sequence selection** - to pass structural validation and proceed to taxonomic validation, a sequence must satisfy *all* of:
   - No original `N`s (`barcode_ambiguous_bases_original == 0`)
   - No stop codons (`stop_codons == 0`)
   - A valid reading frame (`reading_frame >= 0`)
   - Sufficient informative content (`barcode_base_count > 300` bp)
   - Acceptable post-processing quality (`barcode_ambiguous_bases` < 30% of `barcode_base_count`)

## Taxonomic validation ##
Taxonomic validation runs in two steps, via `tv_local_blast.py` and `tv_blast2taxonomy.py`.

**1. Local BLASTn search.** Parallel BLASTn searches against a local database, either built from a multi-FASTA with `makeblastdb` or supplied pre-built. The e-value threshold is hardcoded to 1e-5. Per-sequence TSV outputs (outfmt 6) hold the top 500 hits ordered by descending percent identity; the top 100 are carried into the summary CSV.
 
**2. Taxonomic assignment validation.** BLASTn results are checked against expected taxonomy using hierarchical matching and quality-based filtering:
1. Parse the local BLASTn summary CSV, per-sample expected lineages, database taxonomy mappings, and structurally validated sequences.
2. Discard hits below `min_pident` or below `min_length` (set in `beegees/config/config.yaml`).
3. Compare remaining hits against the expected lineage by exact string matching at family, genus or species level (highest rank considered is set by `taxval_rank`). The first (top) hit matching at any allowed rank is accepted.
4. Select the best sequence per process ID from those with taxonomy matches, prioritising in order: lowest matched rank (species > genus > family), then fewest gaps, fewest mismatches, highest percent identity, lowest e-value, highest alignment length, highest MGE `s` value, highest MGE `r` value, and finally sequences containing `fcleaner` in the seq ID (preferring cleaned consensus sequences).
5. Write the taxonomic validation CSV.

## Final metric integration ##
`val_csv_merger.py` merges validation outputs with preprocessing and recovery statistics into `{run_name}_final_metrics.csv`, consolidating:
- Read QC metrics (fastp, plus TrimGalore for PE)
- Reference retrieval results (Gene Fetch)
- Barcode recovery statistics (MitoGeneExtractor, fasta_cleaner)
- Structural validation metrics
- Taxonomic validation results

## MultiQC report ##
Every run produces a self-contained interactive HTML report at `05_barcoding_outcome/multiqc_report/multiqc_report.html`, copied to `{output_dir}/multiqc_report.html`, integrating:
- Read QC summary (fastp)
- Barcode recovery rates (MitoGeneExtractor)
- Structural and taxonomic validation outcomes
- Per-sample barcoding success (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)

# Screening negative controls #
If you have negative controls, such as well H12 of a 96-well plate, we recommend including them in `samples.csv` using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the plate as the expected taxonomy.
 
In our testing, this is often sufficient to identify inter-well contamination within a plate, whether or not a barcode consensus sequence is successfully constructed. For example, in a plate of Hymenoptera containing both Ichneumonidae and Braconidae samples, the LCA would be Hymenoptera.

# Future developments #
- Expand supported markers beyond COI-5P and rbcL. Will require marker-specific HMMs, BLAST databases and associated taxonomy files for barcode validation. Next likely marker to be added = MatK.
- Update 01_human_cox1_filter.py so it does not solely filter aligned reads against human COI, but instead against the whole human mitogenome.
- Replacement of final BLASTn taxonomic validation and parsing, using the [BOLDistilled](https://www.boldsystems.org/data/boldistilled/) COI database, with a SINTAX approach instead. SINTAX should be faster, does taxonomic traversal, and provides a confidence score for each match.
